# Coursera Machine Learning
my first machine learning class. There are 3 divided courses and it can be seen in `Coursera` , and you can find lots of resources in billbill and github 

### COURSE 1 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- linear regression and logistic regression

### COURSE 2 Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

### COURSE 3  Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
In the third course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
